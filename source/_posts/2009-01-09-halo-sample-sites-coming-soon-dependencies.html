<p>I've seen a big spike in <a href="http://halo-php.org/">Halo</a> downloads, but the downloads for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hc-php/">hc-php</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skittle-php/">Skittle</a> and <a href="http://substrate-php.org/">Substrate</a> have hardly moved. While I am very excited that people are wanting to try out Halo, it concerns me that nobody is downloading the dependencies. :) So I have added the dependency notices to the Halo website (it was only on the Google Code page previously) in an effort to hopefully spread the word.</p>
<p>It also occurs to me that with the lack of documentation people downloading Halo for the first time are likely going to be very confused and probably <em>rm -rf</em> the package pretty quickly. I am going to set a goal for myself to get a sample Halo project online with some basic documentation to get people started using Halo.</p>
<p>While you are waiting for Halo documentation, I suggest taking a look at <a href="http://substrate-php.org/">Substrate</a> to get acquainted with it. Since Halo is built on Substrate, a working knowledge of Substrate is going to be critical. Unlike Halo, Substrate actually has at least a bit of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/substrate-php/wiki/SampleCode">documentation to get you started</a>.</p>
<p>Also, if you take the time to download Halo, please take a few extra seconds to join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/halo-php">Halo General Discussion</a> group and at the very least introduce yourself. I like to ramble on at great length, so if you have any questions, please feel free to post away! That is what the group is for!</p>
