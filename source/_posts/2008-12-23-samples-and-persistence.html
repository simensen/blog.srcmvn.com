<p><img src="/images/media_httpnotinvented_zmxfv.png" alt="Samples and Persistence" /><br /><strong>Repose</strong><br /> Insert and Update functionalities were added in the way of working save() and update() methods for repose_Session. Still a long ways to go, but definitely seems like it is heading in the right direction!  <a href="http://code.google.com/p/repose-php/wiki/SampleCode">Sample Code</a> showing usage of Repose was added to the Wiki today. Most of this is taken directly from the (working) unit test that was checked in earlier today.</p>
