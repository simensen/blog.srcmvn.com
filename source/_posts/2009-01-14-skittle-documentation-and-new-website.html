<p>A few days ago <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/andre_c">Alvaro</a> had asked me if there were any docs for Skittle. At the time there was none. As of last night this has changed. Skittle is sporting fresh <a href="http://skittle-php.org/phpdoc">phpdoc</a> and a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skittle-php/wiki/CheatSheet">cheat sheet</a>. The phpdoc pushed my timetable forward for getting a <a href="http://skittle-php.org/">standalone website for Skittle</a>&nbsp;as I wanted the phpdoc for Skittle to live somewhere other than the Halo website.</p>
<p>So yeah, as of last night, <a href="http://skittle-php.org/">skittle-php.org</a> is alive.</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, <a href="http://ohloh.com/">Ohloh's</a> code analysis is pretty cool. If not a bit damning. Proud of my new projects, I happily enlisted the subversion repositories only to discover that it puts up nice little yield/warning signs on account of my present lack of commenting and documentation. I took it as a challenge. And I quote:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<p>Across all PHP projects on Ohloh, 30% of all source code lines are comments. For skittle-php, this figure is 53%.</p>
<p>This very impressive number of comments puts skittle-php among the best 10% of all PHP projects on Ohloh.</p>
<p>A high number of comments might indicate that the code is well-documented and organized, and could be a sign of a helpful and disciplined development team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah. Take that, Ohloh.</p>
<p>Seriously, though. It seems like it might be nice to have some sort of external accountability on my projects.&nbsp;On that note, when am I going to set myself on the much larger tasks of documenting Repose (5% commented), Substrate (1% commented) and Halo (6% commented)?</p>
<p>.oO( Bored. )</p>
