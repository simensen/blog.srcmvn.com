<p>Learned a new lesson today in C++. Although many functions and methods apparently support the char* to string conversions pretty easily, the *printf family of functions do not. I suppose this makes sense now that I know this, but it really did not make a lot of sense for the better part of two days.  Thanks to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow</a> community for helping me realize that <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/617358/get-optarg-as-a-c-string-object">the problem I've been wrestling with</a> actually had nothing at all to do with getopts_long at all.</p>
