<p>After spending some time looking into S3 and CloudFiles I decided that I didn't really want to lock into one vendor for storage. I also was not keen on the idea of relying on S3 or CloudFiles for development installations. I did a quick search for an abstraction layer for PHP that would let me choose one, or the other, and not have to change much of my implementation code. Utilizing a dependency injection framework like <a href="http://substrate-php.org/">Substrate</a> would make this all the more desirable.</p>
<p>My search was neither long nor fruitful. There are several standalone libraries for accessing S3and Mosso provides a pretty complete PHP solution for accessing CloudFiles. However, from my searching I was unable to locate an abstraction library that would let me move between implementations freely.</p>
<p>My goal is for Safsi to fill this hole. I intend to write Local Disk, S3 and CloudFiles implementations. This should let a user code using a Local Disk implementation in a development environment and use either a S3 or CloudFiles implementation in production. It should also allow a production environment to switch from one storage provider to another (S3 to CloudFiles or CloudFiles to S3).</p>
<p>Safsi has a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/safsi-php/">project page on Google code</a>. Not sure how quickly I'll have something useful given my busy schedule for the foreseeable future but I definitely plan on working on this project along side <a href="http://not-invented-here.com/software-projects/">my other software projects.</a></p>
