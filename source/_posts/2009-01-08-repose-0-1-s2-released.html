<p>A new snapshot of <a href="http://repose-php.org/">Repose</a> has been released and is ready for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/repose-php/downloads/list">download</a>. The main change between s1 and s2 is the fix to allow for Repose to return more than one object by querying. A test case was added to detect this in the future. Check the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/repose-php/source/detail?r=45">changeset notes</a> for more details on this particular bug.</p>
<p>All previous version of Repose have been marked as deprecated.</p>
