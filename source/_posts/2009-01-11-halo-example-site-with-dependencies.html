<p><a href="http://halo-php.org/">Halo</a> is sporting a very <a href="http://code.google.com/p/halo-php/source/browse/#svn/trunk/examples/single">quick and dirty example site</a> in the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/halo-php/downloads/list">newest trunk snapshot "full" builds</a>. The example site includes the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hc-php/">hc-php</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skittle-php/">Skittle</a> and <a href="http://substrate-php.org/">Substrate</a> dependencies in the <code>vendors/</code> folder so it should work out of the box. In theory. Thanks to <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/andre_c">Alvaro's</a> help, I can verify that this has worked for at least one person!</p>
<p>Halo's documentation is still pretty scarce, but I did manage to throw together a quick cheat sheet for <a href="http://code.google.com/p/halo-php/wiki/halo_HttpRequest">halo_HttpRequest</a>. This class is used by the controller and is available by way of the <code>$httpRequest</code> variable in the view. It provides a standardized way to access HTTP Request information, including but not limited to query params, URL params and POST params.</p>
<p>So, I have made quite a bit of headway on&nbsp;<a href="http://not-invented-here.com/2009/01/09/halo-sample-sites-coming-soon-dependencies/">the goal I set for myself on Friday</a>. Hopefully there will be more docs by the end of the week!</p>
