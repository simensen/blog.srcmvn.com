<p><img src="/images/media_httphalogencrea_bHgoE.jpg" alt="s3a site beta launch (or the first Substrate and Halo 2.0 based site!)" />After several months of planning and development, we finally launched the new <a href="http://s3a.us/" target="_blank">s3a</a> site in beta&nbsp;this weekend. In addition to this being super cool for s3a, it means a huge leap for the <a href="http://halogencreative.com/" target="_blank">Halogen Creative</a>.&nbsp;The new s3a site is the first site to be built using the Halo 2.0 web application framework and the first site to be built using Substrate.  The&nbsp;original version of Halo has sort of stalled in development with no real changes in the last year. During that time, I've been exposed to several technologies that helped shape the new direction of Halo. A good chunk of that was working in <a href="http://cakephp.org" target="_blank">CakePHP</a> in PHP and <a href="http://springframework.org/" target="_blank">Spring Framework</a> in Java.  One of the key components to Halo 2.0 is the PHP IoC/DI container, Substrate. Substrate is a loose port of the Spring Framework to PHP. Sounds crazy? It is, sort of. I'm pretty excited about this project and hope to open it up for general use if I ever get around to documenting it.  Skittle, Halogen Creative's template engine, has remained more or less intact for core functionality. Halo itself now offers up some additional help in the way of View Helpers ( similar to CakePHP ) which makes UI templating that requires some more programmatic things considerably easier. The combination of Skittle and user-defined View Helpers is very powerful.  A component that is currently lacking is a good PHP ORM. While researching, I came across a few potential candidates ( <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" target="_blank">Doctrine</a> and <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org" target="_blank">Propel</a> ) but none of them really looked like what I was hoping for ( more or less a <a href="http://hibernate.org/" target="_blank">Hibernate</a> for PHP ). The jury is still out on where I will be going with this, but as for now I am going to be sticking with raw PDO access until I decide to move on something more...</p>
