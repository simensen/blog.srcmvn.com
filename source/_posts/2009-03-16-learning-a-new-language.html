<p>Today I learned that the next stage in my ongoing project is going to involve writing a lot of Python code. Just a few days ago I was thinking about the fact that I had to resurrect my C++ knowledge recently (over the last month and a half) and the fact that now know a decent amount of Java... and it made me wonder why I had never learned Python?  Traditionally, I have never picked up a language "just because." It is great to be in a position to have these new language opportunties crop up.  By the end of this project, I will likely even have some desktop application programming experience under my belt (D-Bus and Qt) and that could come in quite handy in the future.</p>
