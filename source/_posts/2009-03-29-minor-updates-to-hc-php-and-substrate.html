<p>I checked in a couple of minor changes to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hc-php/">hc-php</a> and to <a href="http://substrate-php.org/">Substrate</a> tonight.  Two implementations of hc_configuration_IConfiguration were added, hc_configuration_PdoConfiguration and hc_configuration_CompositeConfiguration. Both are pretty naieve examples of implementation hc_configuration_IConfiguration (both are backed by hc_configuration_MapConfiguration) but they get the job done.  The following is an example of being able to set defaults in a properties file and allowing for overriding defaults in a database.</p>

<p>In this case, the stringConfiguration object will combine the properties from the strings.properties file and the values stored in the database. I am using this with a new <a href="http://halo-php.org/">Halo</a> View Helper named&nbsp;halo_StringViewHelper. Look for more information on that soon, but here is a quick usage example from a Skittle template.</p>
<p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/288216">https://gist.github.com/288216</a></p></p>
<p>First, the properties configuration is checked for name.long, and if it is not located the PDO configuration is checked. If neither configuration contains the key name.long, then ${name.long} is entered into the template.</p>
