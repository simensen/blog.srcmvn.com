<p>Thanks to <a href="http://xrotwang.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/pretty-printing-xml/">Our Line's Too Short</a>, I found a quick example of how to pretty print XML. This is bound to come up again, so I'm going to reproduce it here:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_short_quote">tidy -i -xml -asxml input.xml</blockquote>
<p>The -i flag indents, -xml specifies that the input is well formed XML and -asxml will convert well formed HTML to XHTML.</p>
