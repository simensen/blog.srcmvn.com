<p>There have been a few times that I have wanted to be able to dig into a Node with libxml++ to find out more raw information, like the type of node it is. I haven't had much luck with the Node class itself, but I did find the cobj() reference. It returns a reference to a _xmlNode structure that contains the name and type of node being worked with. I have not yet found many good examples of what one can do with an _xmlNode structure, but I did find the basic information I was looking for.</p>
