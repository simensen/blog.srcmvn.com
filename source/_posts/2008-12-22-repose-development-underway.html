<p><img src="/images/media_httpnotinvented_JAsdI.png" alt="Repose Development Underway!" /><br /><strong>Repose</strong><br /> After spending some time checking out the PHP ORM tool&nbsp;<a href="http://outlet-orm.org/">Outlet</a>, I decided to take a stab at refactoring some of the code to handle protected and private properties differently. In the process, it became clear to me that some of the changes I was looking to make would require some hefty overhauling of many parts of the system. Rather than diving head first into an existing project and trying to make massive changes, I opted to start from scratch. Repose was born.  Repose is a name I have long liked for a persistence layer, but Halogen Creative collectively decided to run with Pitchfork the last time we fired up a DAO project. From a marketing perspective, Halo and Pitchfork seemed to play with each other nicely than Halo and Repose.  There is not a whole lot of information available yet, but there is a <a href="http://repose-php.org/">Repose website</a>, a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/repose-php">Repose Google Code hosted project</a> and a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/repose-php">Repose General Discussion Google Group</a> setup if anyone is interested in seeing what is going on.</p>
