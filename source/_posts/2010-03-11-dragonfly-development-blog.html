<p>As of late last night, <a href="http://dflydev.com/">Dragonfly Development's</a> <a href="http://blog.dflydev.com/">blog</a> is active.</p>
<p>I am still trying to figure out how I plan to handle posts between the two, but I think that most of the high level release notes will be posted there and commentary or more in-depth discussion on design will live here at Source Maven.</p>
<p>In any event, I've been putting a little extra effort into pushing my dflydev related projects out with a large focus on <a href="http://github.com/dflydev/">getting them up on GitHub</a>. Hoping to keep this up...</p>
