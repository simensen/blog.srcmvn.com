      <blockquote><div>
    
      <p>Today Apple released <a href="http://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode 4</a>.  We're pretty excited over here because Xcode 4 is the first Xcode release to support git natively.  What's even more, new projects default to git repos!</p>

<p>As you work on your project, you can see the git status of the files  showing A and M in the sidebar:</p>

<p>Of course if you want to share your project with others, GitHub is an awesome place to do that now that you'll be working with git.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/languages/Objective-C">Objective-C</a> projects have slowly been growing popularity here on GitHub, and it's now on the cusp of being one of our Top 10 languages.</p>

<p>If you're looking for some great Objective-C projects, take a look at some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/johnezang/JSONKit">JSONKit</a> - A brand new (and insanely fast) JSON Library</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator">Mogenerator</a> - Generate classes from core data models</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/digdog/UIDickBar">UIDickbar</a> - In case you'd like to improve the experience of your iOS apps.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/joericioppo/MyStyledView">MyStyledView</a> - A great base for styling views in AppKit.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/joshaber/JAListView">JAListView</a> - A UITable-inspired NSTableView replacement for AppKit.</li>
</ul><p>Hopefully with the release of Xcode 4 we'll see an explosion of Cocoa on GitHub (hey, I can dream).</p>
