<p><img src="/images/media_httpnotinvented_atsuo.jpg" alt="Gonna Google Code It!" /><br /><strong>Halogen Creative</strong><br /> I have finally decided to start pushing my code out to the rest of the world. Several new projects were added to Google code this weekend ( <a href="http://code.google.com/p/hc-php/">hc-php</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skittle-php/">skittle-php</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/halo-php/">halo-php</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/substrate-php/">substrate-php</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/repose-php/">repose-php </a>) and will hopefully be fleshed out a bit more in the coming weeks.  I am excited to try out Google code and see how well it works. It was a little unfortunate that "halo" and "substrate" were both project names already taken on SourceForge... apparently Google has decided that if a project exists on SourceForge they won't allow it to exist in their system. I had hoped to avoid the *-php suffix, but it seems like, "Everyone else is doing it" ( <a href="http://code.google.com/p/smarty-php/">smarty-php</a> ) so I guess it cannot hurt too badly. I hope.</p>
