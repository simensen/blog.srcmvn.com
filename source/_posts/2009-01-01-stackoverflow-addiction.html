<p>Josh sent me to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> back in September of 2008. When I took a look I thought it looked interesting but I couldn't see actually trying to keep up on what looked to be several updates per minute. Plus I did not have any immediate questions I needed to have answered so I moved on, and never looked back.  Until yesterday.  Now I am hooked.  Josh has asked me several times over the last few years if I was involved in any online software communities. Message boards, blogs or IRC channels really never seemed all that enjoyable to me, even though I do enjoy talking about code and working with other people on problems.  Stackoverflow looks to be <em>the</em> place to get involved and discuss things without having to get overly bogged down in long forum posts or keeping an IRC window open all day long. It is not <em>just</em>&nbsp;about asking questions. It actually seems to be at least as much about <em>answering</em>&nbsp;questions. Which is far more interesting for me about 95% of the time!  What surprises me is that I have not stumbled onto this site during all of my software searched on Google. This site is far more fun and useful that Experts Exchange I have grown to hate. Hopefully it starts popping up in more Google searches as time goes on...</p>
