I should probably have started out looking for packaging systems. Still, it could end up being just as messy (and easily as time consuming) to try and get an existing packaging system to work. Still, <a href="http://phing.info">phing</a> may be exactly what I am looking for... especially with zacharydanger's <a href="http://github.com/zacharydanger/git-phing/blob/master/build.xml">git-phing</a> extension.
