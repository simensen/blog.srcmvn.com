<p>I started <a href="http://halo-php.org/phpdoc/">documenting</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://halo-php.org/">Halo</a> this evening. I checked in the updated code and updated the <a href="http://skittle-php.org/">Skittle</a> install from the example site to the latest <a href="http://code.google.com/p/skittle-php/downloads/list">Skittle snapshot</a> before <a href="http://code.google.com/p/halo-php/downloads/list">tagging a new Halo snapshot</a> (halo-snapshot-20090116005031).</p>
<p>I have seen a few dozen downloads since I started pushing Halo but have not received any feedback on it yet. I realize it is still pretty rough around the edges, but hopefully there is something I can learn from your experience to start smoothing it out! So please, if you download it, let me know what your initial thoughts are, even if they were, "ugh" followed by <em>rm -rf</em>.</p>
