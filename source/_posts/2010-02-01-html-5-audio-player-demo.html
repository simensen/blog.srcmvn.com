<p>To teach myself a little about HTML 5 and its built-in support for rich media, I built a <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com/pub/html5audioplayer/">proof-of-concept HTML5 audio player</a>, written entirely in HTML 5, JQuery and CSS 3. It more or less replaces all the functionality of the <a href="http://www.scottandrew.com">Flash audio player on my music site</a>.</p>
<p>It took a little over two hours starting from nothing. Developed it in Safari 4.0 and works great with that browser. Haven't yet tested it in Firefox 3.5, which claims HTML 5 audio/video media support as well. (UPDATE: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_audio_and_video_in_Firefox">Firefox doesn't support the MP3 format</a>. You're stuck with Ogg or WAV.) It "works" in Mobile Safari on my iPhone 3G, but it's not pretty: the audio element is visible and the MP3 launches a Quicktime player.</p>
<p>Think what you want about the iPad and Apple's non-support of Adobe Flash. If you're a web developer and not excited about creating rich media experiences with HTML, Javascript and CSS, you just might be a dried-out husk.</p>

<p>The more I see about HTML5, the more I feel like I should really jump in.</p>
