<div>Sometimes debug_backtrace can be a little too much. Especially if you are dealing with large objects. It can be nice to break out some of the more informational pieces and only display those. Quick example:</div>
<p><p><a href="https://gist.github.com/346199">https://gist.github.com/346199</a></p></p>
<p>Something like this can be easily turned into a function and added to a debugging/logging library.</p>
