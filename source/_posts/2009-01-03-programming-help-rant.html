<p>I feel a little guilty having complained about the "PHP Community" not being able to help me out with the cURL problem. I am not really a part of any programming community, PHP or otherwise, so being frustrated by not being helped in under five days is pretty unfair.  I hope to change that. I am totally digging&nbsp;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">SO</a>&nbsp;and hope to continue to spend time there. I am also going to be on the lookout for other communities I can join. Suggestions for good online communities are welcome!</p>
